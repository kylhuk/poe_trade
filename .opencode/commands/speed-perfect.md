Goal: $ARGUMENTS

Workflow
1) Restate goal + constraints; ask only the essential clarifying questions.
2) Produce a tight implementation plan with acceptance criteria.
3) Delegate:
   - go-fast for implementation
   - go-tests for tests
   - runner for command execution evidence
   - review for final audit
4) Return a compact evidence bundle: files touched + commands run + outputs + remaining risks.
